    <p>A quick and yummy way to prepare crispy tilapia the whole family will love, without frying. I get asked to make
        this several times a week by everyone in my family, especially the kids!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets, thawed if frozen</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine Parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat tilapia filets dry with paper towels. Spritz both sides with cooking spray, then press both sides of the
            filets into the Parmesan mixture. Shake off any excess, then spray again with cooking spray. Place in the
            basket of the air fryer.

        </li>
        <li>Cook until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes. You may need to cook the fish in 2 batches,
            depending on the size of your air fryer.

        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
